Implement a Todo List Component
Assignment 1
Part 1 - Implement a Todo List Component 
Create a new React component called TodoList that displays a list of todo items. 
Each todo item should have a description and a checkbox to mark it as completed.
The component should use the useState hook to manage its state and the initial value of the state should be an empty array.
Clicking the checkbox for a todo item should toggle its completion status.
Part 2 - Pass props to the TodoList Component
Create a new React component called TodoApp that renders a TodoList component and a form to add new todo items.
The form should have an input field for the todo item description and a button to add the item to the list.
The TodoApp component should pass the list of todo items to the TodoList component as a prop.
Part 3 - After successful execution save all the changes to the local system.
Part 4 - Create a new repository on GitHub named "your-last-name_INF655".  
Part 5 - Create a git ignore file and add node modules files in that. 
Part 6 - Confirm you have committed all changes to your local repository with git. Then push your local git repository code to your GitHub repository. 
Part 7 - Copy the URL to your GitHub repository. 
Part 8 - In the submission area, click the "Write Submission" button and paste the URL to your GitHub repository.
